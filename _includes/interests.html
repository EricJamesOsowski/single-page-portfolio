        <p>My personal interests include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Sailing</b>. Born and raised in Minnesota, I have always been
            around lakes and have always been astounded by the beauty of the
            water. This has led me to develop a passion for canoeing, kayaking,
            and most recently, sailing!
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Technology</b>. I've been enthusiasticly learning about the
            advancement of technology since I was a child taking apart and
            reassembling any computer I could get my hands on.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Hiking</b>. I have found that nothing helps me to shake off daily stress and gain perspective on life than getting lost in some of the breathtaking trails that Minnesota is home to.

            easier to auto-provision a headless Raspberry PI, get it onto your
            WiFi network, and deploy simple Python and Ruby scripts that run at
            startup - all without needing to plug in a keyboard/monitor.
